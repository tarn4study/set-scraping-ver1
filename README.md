# set-scraping-ver1
My dad ask me to create a program that easy to use for him to get the data from SET website. This is my first project and my first time try to create something in GitHub.
This can scrape only SET website on page financial statement and only available for Thai language since my dad is Thai. Other website is going to cause errors.
It can only export the first table on the website since I forgot to make it export 2 tables. However, in version 2 it will export 2 tables.
So COOL!!!
Ps. I use pipenv for this so there is a pipfile that contains the requirement.

## How to use
1. Run program2.py
2. Enjoy!

## Requirement 
1. pandas
2. selenium
3. webdriver-manager
4. lxml
5. openpyxl 
6. pyqt5
Extra - pyinstaller to create it as a program :)
